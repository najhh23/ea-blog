Hey Madden fans, welcome back to Gridiron Notes! This latest update for Madden NFL 26 
includes various gameplay tuning, new Superstar Drake Maye, and new gear. Read on for the full breakdown of what’s new in this update!
</p>
<br>

<p><h3>Gameplay</h3></p>
<br>
<p>
<ul>
  <p>New Superstar: </p>
<li> Drake Maye | Patriots, QB</li>
  <li>Protected</li>
  <li>Long Range Deadeye</li>
  <li>Fearless</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>
<p><h3>Gameplay General</h3></p>
<br>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Addressed an issue where users were able to hot route bubble route receivers on RPO Bubble plays after audibling from a different formation.
    <ul>
<br>
      <li> DEV NOTE: In order to keep the integrity and authenticity of designed RPO screens, we did not allow users to Hot Route the players involved in the screen as that would be very unrealistic. 
A bug in the system allowed users to do this after an audible but we resolved that and now you are no longer able to Hot Route the players involved in the screen at any point.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li>Addressed an issue where a ball carrier would freeze during the get up after playing a reach the ball over the line tackle animation.</li>
