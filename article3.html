The postseason is finally here, and it’s time to celebrate in Madden NFL 26. Play through the entire 
NFL Playoffs with new content and player items released after each round, take on the Super Bowl with legends of the 
big game past and present, 
and honor some icons of the game during Black History Month. 
Plus, work your way up the Field Pass for upgradeable players like Drake Maye and Steve Smith Sr.
</p>

<p><b> ULTIMATE TEAM™ EVENTS</p></b>
<br> 

<p><b> PLAYOFFS </b></p>
<br>
<p>
The most exciting part of the NFL season is now officially in Madden NFL 26 Ultimate Team. 
As each round of the Playoffs concludes, new player items, Challenges, and store offers will be released so you can keep building your dream roster, postseason-style.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Not only will new player items be released after each round of the Playoffs, 
these new items will also get special round-specific chemistries that can give you even more of a boost with each release.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Back in the Ultimate Team Playoffs this year are upgradeable Team Reps: 14 players 
(1 from each Playoffs-bound team) are available for a short time as a login reward during the first few days of the program. 
Use Upgrade Tokens to boost these stars all the way to 94 OVR – but don't be too hasty, because Team Reps who win their games will be upgradeable for fewer tokens.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Don’t miss Fan Forecasts, where you can pick the winner of each Playoffs 
matchup to earn Upgrade Tokens for upgrading Team Reps players or in the Playoffs Store. 
Each round, you'll get a limited amount of unique round-specific Forecast Tokens with a limited amount of time to place them in Forecast Sets.
